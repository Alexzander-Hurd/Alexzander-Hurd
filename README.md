# Hi, I’m Alex 👋

I'm a **systems software engineer** specializing in backend development and system integration. My primary focus is building robust, scalable APIs and web applications using **ASP.NET Core**, as well as crafting backend services in **Python** and **Go**. I have significant experience designing and optimizing database solutions, and I enjoy tackling complex problems that sit at the intersection of software and infrastructure.

### 🚀 What I Do

- Develop backend APIs and MVC web apps in ASP.NET Core  
- Build small, efficient backend services in Python and Go  
- Design and optimize database schemas and queries  
- Integrate systems and automate workflows  
- Explore new frameworks and technologies  

### 🛠️ Featured Projects

- **[Portfolio-Web](https://github.com/Alexzander-Hurd/Portfolio-Web)**  
  My personal website built with the Astro framework, serving as a central hub for my projects, blog, and professional profile.

- **[Portfolio-Blog](https://github.com/Alexzander-Hurd/Portfolio-Blog)**  
  My blog, powered by Obsidian-generated content, where I share technical insights, project updates, and personal interests.

### 🌱 Outside of Tech

When I'm not coding, I'm an enthusiastic wildlife and bird photographer. I spend most weekends exploring nature reserves run by the National Trust, RSPB, and Yorkshire Wildlife Trust—always on the lookout for new species and great photo opportunities.
